This work introduces the resource efficient method for implementing the unified hardware for the substitution box for AES encryption and decryption by exploiting the concept of unique mapping between Isomorphic fields followed by resource sharing in between at the pre-and post processing stages by choosing the hardware efficient and secure isomorphic and inverse isomorphic matrix described in the paper through which one can map the elements from GF(2^8) to GF(2^4)^2, compared to the classical lookup table based s-box this method provides a gate level RTL with better LUT utilization, Power consumption The design is synthesized and implemented for Spartan 3E XC3S100E series FPGA using xilinx ISE tool, with 94mW power consumption, This is relatively 40% more efficient approach than classical LUT based method.

RTL for s box hardware for AES algorithm is efficiently implemented via gate level design by Field isomorphism and composite field arithmetic. In conventional designs memory based implementation for Forward and Inverse S-box operation is done which requires significant area and Power for FPGA implementation. This approach is implemented by inspiring from the base paper uploaded in the repository.
